# About Me

<img src="mingxin.jpg" class="floatpic">

Here is **Mingxin Wu (武明信)**.<br>

I graduated from Peking University in July 2024 with a Doctor of Science degree.
I am currently employed at Zhengzhou University as an Associate Professor. 
In recent years, my research has focused on intelligent manufacturing and biomimetic intelligent robots. I have published over 10 papers ， such as Research, Advanced Science, Biosensors and Bioelectronics, Soft Robotics, and IEEE Transactions on Robotics, with a total citation count exceeding 490（https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?hl=zh-CN&pli=1&user=LLUHaXIAAAAJ）. I have filed for 7 patents, with 4 granted. 
My research on the interdisciplinary application of 3D printing in medicine has been featured by X-MOL and EFL WeChat public accounts. 
My work on underwater grasping hands has been reported by Peking University's official WeChat public account, Robot Lecture Hall, and other media outlets. 
It has been cited by a Science sub-journal and featured in numerous review journals. I have also been interviewed and featured by CCTV's Science and Education Channel and Hunan TV.<br>

If you are interested in any aspect of me, I am always open to discussions and collaborations. Feel free to reach out to me at  mingxinwu@zzu.edu.cn
